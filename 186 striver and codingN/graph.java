                                    NOTES
 1.GRAPH - in the conected component of graph there will be always (v-1) 
 edges
 2.IN DIRECTED GRAPH -and max number of edge in graph is v(v-1)  
 3. IN UNDIRECTED GRAPH v(v-1) /  2 ; beacause single edge work as a two edegs in DIRECTED gr

1.A                                  MATRIX

public static void main(String [] args)

    int E = s.nextInt();
    int edge[]][] = new int[V][V];
